/**
 * The available options for [[ConsumerSettings#rebalanceRevokeMode]].<br><br>
 *
 * Available options include:<br>
 *  - [[RebalanceRevokeMode.Eager]] old behaviour, to release assigned partition as soon as possible,<br>
 *  - [[RebalanceRevokeMode.Graceful]] modified behavior, waiting for configured amount of time:
 *    {{{org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig.SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG}}} It is guaranteed by kafka protocol
 *    that after that timeout old consumer will be marked as dead.
 *
 * Default mode is [[RebalanceRevokeMode.Eager]] which is exactly the same as old behavior and can be preferred
 * if rebalance need to happen as quickly as possible and having multiple consumers working on a partition for a moment
 * is not a problem.
 *
 * On the other hand if you want stricter guarantees about processing and attempt to wait for existing streams to finish
 * processing messages before releasing partition choose [[RebalanceRevokeMode.Graceful]].
 * Because stream is signalled to be shutdown in-flight commits might be lost and some messages might be processed again
 * after new assignment.
